          <p>Hello! My name is Christopher Alexander Payumo. I was born on October 20, 1997 in Vallejo, CA and later raised in Fairfield, CA.
             In 2015, I left Fairfield to attend college at The University of California, Merced, studying computer science and engineering.
            I completed my undergraduate studies and received my Bachelor's of Science degree on December 20, 2019.

            <br><br>Currently, I am back living in Fairfield working on projects and refining my coding skills and knowledge.
            I am seeking opportunities to advance my career as a software engineer in either app development,
            web development, or other entry level positions in software. Thanks for taking the time to get to know me! :)<br>
